As the fourth step in the Scholar Navis workflow (usually the final step), use the tool to perform a detailed analysis of a specific article.

The analysis primarily includes the following points:

- Article abstract

- Introduction or research background of the article

- Experimental methods

- Experimental conclusions

- Innovations in the experiment

- Shortcomings and defects of the experiment

- Writing style and narrative logic (including writing suggestions)

After the analysis is complete, it supports conversational questioning about the entire article and the summary content.

The following steps are not in any particular order; choose according to your own situation and needs.

<br>1. **Analyze Any Article**

| Item                             | Input Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Selected articles                | This will be automatically filled in after uploading the article (please upload before opening this feature)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Select summary library           | Leave blank                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Adjust GPT's language preference | You can adjust it according to your reading needs and AI capabilities. By default, GPT will respond in the selected language. Generally, the default setting is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Utilize AI-assisted features     | In obtaining the article's title and DOI information, if the existing information is incomplete or inaccurate, ask AI for more accurate information. However, since the process requires an internet connection, AI also needs processing time, so the processing speed is slower. It is recommended to use this when there are fewer articles and lower time requirements. |

The uploaded article will be analyzed, and follow-up questions can be asked after the analysis.

<br>2. **Analyze Articles in the Summary Library**

This step requires executing the plugin twice. That is, steps "1" and "2" below need to be performed in order.

<br>

1. Select the target article from the summary library

| Item                             | Input Prompt                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Selected articles                | Leave blank                                            |
| Select summary library           | Enter the name of the summary library you want to view |
| Auxiliary instructions           | Default (select: No command)                           |
| Adjust GPT's language preference | Invaild, default                                       |
| Utilize AI-assisted features     | Default (select: disabled)                             |

After running the tool, follow the prompts to open a new tab, where you can see all the articles in this summary library. Click on the article title (if there is no article title, it will be the filename, which is generally rare*) to see the summary of the article (displayed in English).

- After selecting a favorable article, select [Copy Article] to copy it, and then you can proceed to the next step

- If prompted that the copy failed, you can choose [Download Article], and then refer to the "Analyze Any Article" step above

2. Analyze the selected article
