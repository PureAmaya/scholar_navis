As the second step in the Scholar Navis tool flow, use this feature to analyze articles and generate a summary with a reasonable breadth of content.

Typically, the summary includes the following points:

- The direction of the research

- Commonalities in the research

- Points of difference in the research

- Innovations in the research

- Conclusions of the research

- Issues or errors encountered in the research

<br>Please note, <font color=red>this feature does not support AI interaction on its own. This means that during communication, the summary content will not be included.</font>

Once the summary is executed, it cannot be modified.

The following steps are not in any particular order and can be chosen based on your own situation and needs.

<br>1. **First-time Summary**

| Adjust GPT's language preference * | You can adjust according to your reading needs and the AI's capabilities. By default, GPT will respond based on the selected language.

| Utilize AI-assisted features       | When obtaining the title and DOI information of the article, if the existing information is incomplete or inaccurate, ask the AI for more accurate information. However, since the process requires an internet connection, the AI also needs time, so the processing speed is slower. It is recommended to use this when there are fewer articles. This feature supports caching; under normal circumstances, the same article is usually not requested multiple times from the AI. |

- *Please note that additional operations will be performed during the first-time summary, which will be influenced by the first-time language preference.*
