因为一开始向只做一个插件来着，所以大量代码都放在这里了。
但是之后发现原版gpt_academic不能满足部分要求，于是就开始对gpt_academic下手了，这就导致一些原本应该放在shared_utils内的公共代码仍然在scholar_navis插件目录中，后面会改，orz

Initially, I was just planning to make a plugin, so a lot of the code ended up here. 
But then I realized that the original gpt_academic doesn't meet some of the requirements, so I started tweaking gpt_academic. This means that some code that should have been in the 'shared_utils' directory is still in the 'scholar_navis' plugin folder. I'll fix that later, sorry in advance!
